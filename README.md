## Back End
- The Api layer of the backend was handled with Flask (using Python)
- The majority of pokemon data was fetched from the open source pokeapi
- Additional data like trainers and type information was ethically scraped from bulbapedia pages
- I implemented a query caching system with a MongoDB Cluster for slow-queries
